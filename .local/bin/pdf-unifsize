# This program adjusts dimensions of selected pages of a pdf file to conform to the dimensions of the majority of the given file.
#
# Usage:
#    pdf-unifsize [file name] [first page to change] [last page to change] [representative page]

# Inputs
fname=$1                        # file name
pgFirst=$2                      # first page to mod
pgLast=$3                       # last page to mod
pgNorm=$4                       # representative page

# Extracting dimensions of rep page
# Note: Arrays in bash is defined by
#       >  arr=(1 3 0)
# Elements are accessed by
#       >  ${arr[0]}
